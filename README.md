## demos on user interface design and the use of machine learning in the design process

* this repository is a collection of interactive sketches on the basics of user interface design.
* please consider visiting: ֍ <a href="https://beyond-interface.info"> beyond-interface.info </a> ֍ for information on the project and for testing all sketches of the repository
* content: the first demos are animations of elements within a grid. Subsequent sketches use image classification or other machine learning methods as user input in order to manipulate elements - in between there are demos that focus on 'common' inputs like mouse or touch input.
* this is meant to be a collection for designers and beginners in creative coding who want to experiment with code. In order to do so, you can either clone this repository and set it up to run on your local machine (e.g. with node.js), or - much easier and more beginner friendly - have a look at ֍ <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/piaoyapia/collections">my p5 collections containing all sketches</a> ֍ (--> still work in progress). You can change the code there and try to make your own experiments directly in the p5.js-editor. This way you don't need download or install any code. By the way: p5.js is a software javascript software library which makes it very easy for designers to get into coding.

* this repository is part of the dissertation 'beyond interface' by <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/pia-scharf-b2a5b0b7">Pia Scharf</a> at Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach am Main.
