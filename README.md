# beyond interface ֍
## demos and sprint projects on user interface design and the use of machine learning in the design process.

* this repository is a collection of interactive sketches on the basics of user interface design.
* The first demos are only animations of elements in the grid. Subsequent sketches use image classification or other machine learning methods as user input - in between there are demos that focus on "common" inputs like mouse or touch input.
* for further information on the project and for testing all sketches, please consider visiting: ֍ https://beyond-interface.info ֍
* for beginners who want to experiment with the code: you can either clone this repository and set it up to run on your local machine (e.g. with node.js), or (much easier and more beginner friendly!) have a look at ֍ https://editor.p5js.org/piaoyapia/collections ֍ (--> still work in progress). You can change the code and try to make your own experiments in the p5.js-editor. p5.js is a software javascript software library which makes it very easy for designers to get into coding.

* this repository is part of the dissertation 'beyond interface' by Pia Scharf at Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach am Main.
